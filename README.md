## Context:
Our interface is a mobile application designed to address the prevalent issue of loneliness among Northeastern University students, with a primary focus on freshmen, transfer students, and international students. Recognizing the unique challenges these individuals face when adapting to a new environment, the interface aims to provide a supportive tool for self-growth that empowers them to foster meaningful connections and combat social isolation.

The interface incorporates a user-centered approach, drawing inspiration from psychological research on goal-setting and motivation. It is rooted in the idea that by empowering users to set and achieve personal goals related to self-development and social interaction, we can positively impact their overall well-being and sense of connection. Users will be prompted to set up goals and then establish stepping stones within them to help them achieve their goals. For instance, a freshman might set a goal to become more involved in campus activities and establish stepping stones within, such as attending a club meeting or initiating a conversation with a classmate. These mini goals act as achievable milestones, guiding users toward their overarching objectives.
